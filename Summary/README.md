## Summary

You have successfully completed this workshop. In this workshop, we learned how EKS Blueprints makes it easy to deploy clusters using IaC Terraform. We learned how to onboard a team from the platform perspective. We also acted as the development team and deployed our first workload using Helm while practicing GitOps with ArgoCD.

We make uses of Karpenter to allow our application to define and uses the ressources it needs, and having our right EC2 nodes at the right time.

We leverage also Argo Rollout and see how we can do Blue/Green deployment for our workloads.

We hope you enjoy this workshop and know that the EKS Blueprint project is open-source, you can know more at : https://github.com/aws-ia/terraform-aws-eks-blueprints
